# Iteration B migration (0.3.0a2)

## Entry points and configuration

`SynthesisKernel.run(PolicyPack, RunConfig)` is the durable Python entry point. `python -m ecoalign_forge run --demo` and the historical `--demo --num-samples 5` spelling use this same kernel. Default mode is now **demo**. Live requires `--mode live`, an explicit USD cap and prices for all configured models. No API calls are made by the acceptance fixtures.

```python
import asyncio
from ecoalign_forge.engine import SynthesisKernel
from ecoalign_forge.policy.builtin import builtin_pack
from ecoalign_forge.schemas.kernel import RunConfig

result = asyncio.run(SynthesisKernel().run(builtin_pack(), RunConfig()))
assert result['exit_code'] == 3  # Four cases abstain without external evidence.
assert result['counts']['dpo_pairs'] == 1
```

Parameters resolve from explicit arguments, JSON configuration, `ECOALIGN_<FIELD>` environment variables, then defaults. Nested model and price mappings are complete mappings, not partial merges. `models` defines generator, moderator, judge and reviewer with model, temperature, max_tokens and optional reasoning_effort. Provider credentials remain environment-only. Historical `CHAOS_CREATOR_MODEL`, `JUDGE_MODEL`, `DEFAULT_*` and `PARSE_*` configure only old adapters; use `ECOALIGN_MODELS` or JSON for the new kernel.

Live configuration must include `execution_mode: live`, positive `max_run_cost`, and `prices` keyed by each requested model ID. Each price declares `input_per_million`, `output_per_million` in USD and `max_input_tokens`. Supply verified provider prices yourself; this release supplies no market-price claims. The input reservation uses a conservative UTF-8 byte bound and refuses prompts exceeding the declared input allowance. Fees are estimates from the frozen requested-model price; actual returned model and provider usage remain separate evidence. Missing usage keeps the reservation unresolved. No supplier bill is inferred.

Defaults: 5 concurrent requests, RPM 60, TPM 100000, 3 total attempts including parsing retries, 120 seconds per request, 30 seconds idle stream timeout, 3600 seconds per run. Group limits coordinate this tool's processes sharing `DATA_DIR` and `quota_group`. Different cap settings require a different explicit group. They do not govern other clients on the provider account. Demo/mock have zero model fees and token reservations.

`min_preference_gap` warns and aliases `min_label_distance`; this is a **semantic change**. Distance counts differing dimension labels and final action, divided by the number of dimensions plus one. Only positive disagreement can form a pair even with threshold zero. More rule citations alone never create a new-kernel pair.

Old `AgentOrchestrator` is a deprecated fixture-only API. Its live path is rejected so it cannot bypass the new budget controls. Old `SupremeJudge.run` remains a deprecated built-in A/B adapter. Historical `JudgeEvaluation`, A artifacts and readers remain available; they do not accept arbitrary PolicyPacks.

## Policy and evidence

PolicyPack schema version 1 declares arbitrary language, dimension labels, actions, rule text, evidence requirements, scores, exceptions and ordered decisions. See [English example](../examples/contact_policy.en.json). Compile freezes canonical JSON and full SHA-256. No code is loaded from packs. Rule/label/score comparisons and `all/any/not` are the only operations. Exceptions suppress rules based on original facts; dimension labels and decisions then use effective facts. Every decision table ends with a default. Unknown facts propagate when they affect a result.

Legacy PolicyInput adapts only the packaged Chinese A/B handbook. Its descriptive fields cannot replace rules. The built-in pack encodes weighted thresholds, matrix, firsthand AI-assistance exception and T3 admission. Generation focus is an intention, never gold truth.

All stages bind the same policy hash. The weak Moderator's full-rule visibility is a fixed configuration; the judge, source reviewer and chosen prompt use the full snapshot. Evidence uses exact Unicode code-point offsets, original text SHA-256 and source ID. No normalization is hidden. Whole-document evidence requires source review. External material is not currently supplied: external rules must remain `unknown`; either `hit` or `miss` makes the gate abstain. Unknowns only permit acceptance when all labels and the decision can be determined independently. Gate acceptance establishes structure, source references and policy consistency, **not semantic truth**.

The corrected `iteration-b-2` demo therefore yields one completed case/pair and four failed cases with `unknown_affects_decision`, returning `partial_failed` / exit 3. Earlier three-pair demo results relied on unverified external misses and are historical, not evidence for the corrected gate.

## Journals, recovery and statuses

New runs: `DATA_DIR/<mode>/runs/<run_id>/run.sqlite3` (WAL, FULL synchronous). JSON summary is derived, not the authority. Requests, raw complete responses, parsed stage results, cases, pair IDs, costs and events are separately committed. A POSIX file lock permits one executor per run; supported release acceptance covers macOS/Linux, not Windows. Use local filesystems supporting SQLite WAL and file locks.

```bash
python -m ecoalign_forge inspect data/demo/runs/RUN_ID
python -m ecoalign_forge resume data/demo/runs/RUN_ID
python -m ecoalign_forge resume data/live/runs/RUN_ID --resolve 'ATTEMPT_ID=retry'
python -m ecoalign_forge resume data/live/runs/RUN_ID --resolve 'ATTEMPT_ID=skip'
python -m ecoalign_forge resume data/live/runs/RUN_ID --max-run-cost 20 --extend-seconds 600
python -m ecoalign_forge export data/demo/runs/RUN_ID
```

Inspect lists unknown attempt IDs. Unknown remote outcomes pause by default. Retry creates a new attempt and retains the old unresolved reservation; skip records an explicit exclusion from further attempts and marks the affected case failed. Saved complete responses are parsed locally first. Only increased budgets and extended deadlines are allowed; code fingerprint, prompt version, models, policy and schema must match. Resume restores the original data and dataset roots from its checkpoint; changing the shared quota root is refused.

Counts rebuild from committed state:

```
completed + failed + unattempted + in_progress = requested
accepted_cases + excluded_cases = completed
```

Completed includes normal semantic exclusions. Failed/abstaining review is failed, not accepted. `no_signal` counts accepted cases without a pair. Historical counts default `in_progress=0`. Codes: completed 0, failed 1, arguments 2, partial_failed 3, paused 4, cancelled 130. Pauses distinguish unknown, budget and deadline. Saving failure cannot return success.

Exports are immutable versions at `DATASETS_DIR/<mode>/<run_id>/<dataset_hash>/`. Temporary files and atomic replacement precede a manifest. No historical files are migrated or overwritten. `pairs.jsonl` is the provenance-rich authority view; TRL standard/conversational, ShareGPT, dataset_info, policy snapshot and a data card are projected views. The manifest hashes each file. Data license defaults to unspecified, independently of Apache-2.0 code licensing.

## Metrics and consumers

Severity is nullable and exists only when the pack supplies a mapping. No severity trend or category distribution measures model improvement. IAA uses coincidence normalization and nominal/ordinal/interval distances. Arbitrary ordinal labels need an explicit order; non-estimable values return null with a reason. Deliberately biased candidates only provide disagreement diagnostics, never independent-annotator reliability or automatic data selection.

Consumer environments are separate and locked under `scripts/consumers/`: TRL 1.14.0 with Transformers 5.6.0 and LLaMA-Factory 0.9.5 with its own compatible dependencies. Torch and torchaudio both pin 2.8.0 in the LLaMA environment. `verify.py` uses the actual consumer preprocessing and collator, an entirely local byte tokenizer, a hard network guard, and no training or pretrained model. These checks validate data consumption, not optimization outcomes.

## Changed historical assertions

- A CLI tests now patch SynthesisKernel and its result dictionary; the same exit-code behavior remains tested.
- Empty raw agreement/kappa/alpha are null instead of zero. Single-category alpha is unestimable instead of perfect.
- `low_confidence` remains a null compatibility field; it no longer grades intentionally biased candidates.
- New-kernel pairing uses label distance; A fixture-only adapter assertions remain unchanged.
- Conversational prompt is a message list, not a string mixed with chosen/rejected message lists.
